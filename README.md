## Description

Boxtracker originally started as a simple system to track the ip addresses of headless streaming server used in various locations when streaming live radio from locations. 

It has since grown a bit in scope, adding uptime tracking and adding of new boxes within a specific ip range to allow other students and project to use the service.

The code has a 10+ year old base and could use a cleanup.

## Proeject goals

Allow servers to register without requiring anything more sophisticated than a cron job like service and a wget like url retreiver, allowing the software to be used on many platforms and not requiring any special software to be installed.
